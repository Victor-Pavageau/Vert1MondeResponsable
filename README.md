## About

This repository is about a website developed to present a school event focused on Sustainable Engineering. The event, organized in collaboration with my entire class, took place on Wednesday, April 17, 2024, in the Darwin district of Bordeaux, France. The website present the event, which included five workshops on various topics related to ecological and societal impacts. The workshops were:

- Greenwashing
- The Truth Behind Green
- Sustainable Mobility
- Adapting Digital Resources for People with Disabilities
- Energy-efficient Building

This project was undertaken during my final year of engineering studies (Bac+5 in the French education system) as part of a school assignment. It provided valuable hands-on experience in web development, project organization, and teamwork. As part of this project, I developed a website to present the event, the workshops, the teams, the location, the date, and all practical information, helping to ensure the eventâ€™s success and accessibility for all participants.
